# OpenX - Piotr Åšliperski - zadanie rekrutacyjne

When i tried to fetch fakestoreapi.com/carts i got following error

{"status":"error","message":"date format is not correct. it should be in yyyy-mm-dd format"}

thats why i manually fetched few carts to json file (located in resources) and im using this json file in my solution.
